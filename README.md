# JavaMatrixRainfall
This application simulates the matrix rainfall as shown in matrix movie. I have tried to improve code readability as much as possible.

#Matrix background animation<br/>
1)A row is represented by Jpanel.<br/>
2)A jpanel(row) contains a group of Jlabels representing a random character.<br/>
3)created multiple jpanels(rows) and added them to frame.<br/>
4)An array of each Jpanel is maintained.<br/>
5)To perform animation , I moved position of each panel in array to next position and initialized the first row with random characters.<br/>
6) Here is a sample captured from my screen- <br/>![alt text](https://github.com/aditkumar1/JavaMatrixRainfall/sample.png)
